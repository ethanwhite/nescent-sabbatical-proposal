Teaching and Mentoring
----------------------
I teach programming, database management, and advanced computational skills to biology students, both through formal university coursework (http://programmingforbiologists.org) and through Software Carpentry workshops (http://software-carpentry.org). I have trained and mentored 2 postdoctoral researchers, 3 graduate students, and 3 undergraduate researchers.
