Introduction and Goals
----------------------
One of the major challenges for synthetic science is the disconnectedness and heterogeneity of existing data.
This makes acquiring and using this data a time consuming and error prone process.

* General mention of data munging being large fraction of work

This is particularly true when trying to work across disciplinary boundaries,
because while researchers may be familiar with the general availability and structure of data in their own discipline,
they are rarely if ever familiar with the structure and availability of data in related disciplines.

Even when individual datasets can be relatively easily acquired,
combining them to be able to answer broad questions is difficult and time consuming for even experienced programmers.
Since most biologists are not computational experts this difficulty can present a strong limit on synthetic science.

It is increasingly recognized that ecological systems cannot be understood in the absence of evolution.
OR
It is increasingly recognized that evolution and ecology are inextricably linked,
and that even on ecological time scales that evolutionary processes have a strong influence on ecological systems.

**Goal 1: Incorporate taxonomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary data into the Retriever** 

**Goal 2: Automatically build synthetic datasets to facilitate interdisciplinary synthesis**

**Goal 3: Convert the Retriever to a browser-based interface**

Anticipated IT Needs & Plan For Making Data/Software Available
--------------------------------------------------------------

I and my lab have a long history of open science activities including the publication of data and software under open source licenses (see our GitHub repositories for examples: http://github.com/weecology). The EcoData Retriever is under an MIT License and all code developed during this project will be released under either MIT or BSD licenses.
